Analysis of the local and global temperature data

This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. For this project:
- data was extracted from a database using SQL;
- manipulated in a spreadsheet (moving averages were calculated to be used in the line chart);
- data visualization was created;
- observations about data visualization were provided.
